*This assignment is designed to test your client-side coding skills and show us
what you’re good at! You can add or modify any of the JavaScript, HTML and CSS
to complete the assignment. jQuery has been included for your convenience, but
is not required. Please do not use jQuery plugins. Also avoid frameworks like
Angular and Backbone. Please make sure the page works as a static page without
the need to run a web server or a build script.*

*First, prioritize the list of tasks below from high to low (1 -> top priority,
6-> lowest priority). Please explain why you choose to prioritize this way,
and what you considered when assigning high or low priority to each task.*

*Second, pick at least two tasks out of the list and implement them. You may choose
whatever tasks you prefer that you think will best reflect your coding skills.
Browser support should include IE8+, Chrome, Safari, FF.*


###First assignment: Task Prioritization

**The tasks are prioritized in the following order:**

_1 Imagine there is a JSON feed with hotels similar to the current one. Design JSON format and use the feed to display similar hotels on the page._

From a marketing point of view, I think showing similar hotels is of the highest priority. It should increase the click and success rate.

_4 Improve the room table. Allow the user to sort the room table by occupancy or price, display a total when the user selects a quantity, display additional information about rooms._

This would be the next thing for a customer to look at and help him in deciding to book.

_3* Add an interactive location block to the page. It should contain a map and some nearby landmarks._

I think it’s important to show nearby landmarks on a map or even some other points of interest so the potential visitor is better informed what facilities are nearby. 

_2* Create a photo carousel using the large photos linked from the thumbnails currently in the page. Include an automatic slideshow mode, add prev/next buttons to manually control the carousel, add a layer that shows the contents of the images alt text._

These days images become more and more important. Visitors need to be excited from the very first moment they enter the website. Big, high quality images help promote the presented hotel.


_6 Improve the facilities block._

I did not exactly understand what kind of tasks this is. Improve the design as the page already shows the facilities? For this the use of icons would be a major improvement. It saves space, leaving more room for other information and does not need to be localized depending on language.

_5* Split the reviews into blocks of 5 and create pagination. Allow the user to sort the reviews by review score._

Showing reviews can help as a last step to decide to book. Having blocks of five at the time and being able to sort on ranking will certainly improve the readability. However because there is already a list of reviews the task seems to be of minor priority.

###Second Assignment: Implementation

I chose not to implement task 1 because requesting a local file is now restricted by most browsers. You’ll need to run it on localhost or setting the allow cross origin flag in the browser settings.

For this assignment I have implemented tasks 2, 3 and 5.
